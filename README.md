# HelicopterGame

### The Idea
Use VHDL to write a helicopter flight game with a Nexys 4 DDR Board.

### The Goals
* Put a helicopter on the screen
* Make the helicopter fly up using a button and fall with gravity
* Add scrolling walls to avoid
* Implement collision logic, showing a game over screen if you collide with a wall
* Randomize wall patterns
* Add a score counter on screen using a bitmap
